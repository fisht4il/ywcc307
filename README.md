 ### Meeting 2:
**Meeting called by**: Jordan Dominguez
**Attendees**: Andres Torres Lugo, Michael Bernstein, Andres Vega
**Type of meeting**: Remote-Work

**Agenda Item**: Generative AI

**Discussion**:
  We put our minds together to research and explore different legal suites currently going on surrounding copyright and AI. We also put together two new slides covering this material, along with some solutions to how copyright can be prevented so that neither party involved in the suit is harmed and both can come to an agreement on some sort of standards.

**Conclusion**:
  Concluded our discussion on generative AI and their copyright involvement including current lawsuits.
  Discussed and brainstormed possible solutions on how to prevent any copyright claiming on AI companies and how they train their models.
  Further discussed how we will be presenting our information, who will be reading slides, how slides will be delegated when presenting, and final roles in our presentation.

**Attendees**: Andres Torres Lugo, Michael Bernstein  
**Type of Meeting**: Remote-Work  

**Agenda Item**: Generative AI  

- **Discussion**:  
  At the moment we're trying to find a solid time to get everyone on board, for full input on what we should do next. Michael and I have decided to focus on describing what is generative AI and the positives and negatives. Additionally, we want to slides to look more presentable in general by providing colors, pictures, sufficient spacing, and concise wording.

- **Conclusion**:  
  Described generative AI in a generalized manner, included things such as common uses, and how it's different from predictive AI models.
  Described the positives and negatives, some positives are boosts in creativity, efficiency, and costs savings. While some potential negatives are, ethical considerations, privacy concerns, and quality control issues.
  Added images relevant to the data found in the slide, updated the color scheme to a light gray, and switched to a more legible font family with multiple weights and styles.
